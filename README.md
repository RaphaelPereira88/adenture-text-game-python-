old-fashioned text-based adventure game.

## The game uses the following functions:

1) The descriptions are printed to the console for the player to see.

2) The time.sleep function is used to create delays between messages so that they aren't all printed at once.

3) The random.choice or random.randint function is used to influence the game so that each game is different in some way.

4) The game uses the input function in combination with conditional statements (e.g., if and while) to create an interactive program.

5) The input function is used to ask the player what they would like to do.

6) The player's choices affect what happens in the game, including:

   - Whether the player wins or loses.
   - Whether to restart or exit after the game is over.
   
7) The game uses a conditional loop to handle invalid input. If the player enters a choice that is not valid, the game gives them the chance to retry until
   they enter a valid option. The game does not crash and does not treat invalid input as a valid choice.
   
8) The program's code is refactored by defining and calling functions. The code includes function definitions that are used to improve the code
   in some way, such as by:

   - Reducing repetition
   - Reducing complexity
   - Improving the readability or organization of the code
   - Each function  have a single purpose and a name that describes that purpose.

10) The code written follows the standard Python Style Guide, such that pycodestyle tool reports zero errors and zero warnings.
11) The program is a playable game, and runs from start to finish without crashing or displaying errors.
